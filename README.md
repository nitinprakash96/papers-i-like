This repository is a list of computer science academic papers that I admire and keep going back to for references. In no way it is one of those _awesome curated list_.

### Language paradigm

- [Why functional programming matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)

### Programming languages

Somedays, I just like to understand the ideology behind a language in terms of its design space and compromises it had to be built upon.

- [Lisp: A language for stratified design](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6064/AIM-986.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)

- [A History of Clojure](https://download.clojure.org/papers/clojure-hopl-iv-final.pdf)


### Programming concepts

This section contains paper that introduced or comprehensively laid down concepts that programmers use extensively.

- [Functional Pearl: I am not a Numberâ€”I am a Free Variable](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~james/RESEARCH/haskell2004.pdf)

- [Tackling the Awkward Squad: monadic input/output, concurrency, exceptions, and foreign-language calls in Haskell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mark.pdf?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Fsimonpj%2Fpapers%2Fmarktoberdorf%2Fmark.pdf)

- [Comprehending Monads](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/WadlerMonads.pdf)
