This repository is a list of computer science academic papers that I admire and keep going back to for references. In no way it is one of those _awesome curated list_.

### Language paradigm

- [Why functional programming matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)

### Programming languages

Somedays, I just like to understand the ideology behind a language in terms of its design space and compromises it had to be built upon.

- [Lisp: A language for stratified design](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6064/AIM-986.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y)

- [A History of Clojure](https://download.clojure.org/papers/clojure-hopl-iv-final.pdf)

- [A History of Haskell: Being Lazy With Class](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/history.pdf)

### Programming concepts

This section contains paper that introduced or comprehensively laid down concepts that programmers use extensively.

- [Functional Pearl: I am not a Numberâ€”I am a Free Variable](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~james/RESEARCH/haskell2004.pdf)

- [Tackling the Awkward Squad: monadic input/output, concurrency, exceptions, and foreign-language calls in Haskell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mark.pdf?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Fsimonpj%2Fpapers%2Fmarktoberdorf%2Fmark.pdf)

- [Comprehending Monads](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/WadlerMonads.pdf)

- [Cache-oblivious Algorithms and Data structures](https://erikdemaine.org/papers/BRICS2002/paper.pdf)

- [Applicative programming with effects](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf)

- [How to make ad-hoc polymorphism less ad hoc](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen-Blott/publication/2710954_How_to_Make_Ad-Hoc_Polymorphism_Less_Ad_Hoc/links/553e01f20cf2fbfe509b81f8/How-to-Make-Ad-Hoc-Polymorphism-Less-Ad-Hoc.pdf)


### Software architecture

Some really helpful papers regarding software architecture and other related patterns.

- [Scaling Memcache at Facebook](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final170_update.pdf)

- [Composable Memory Transactions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/2005-ppopp-composable.pdf)


### Databases

These include designs of some popular storage engines. Some even explore unconventional methods of writing bits and pieces of a storage engine.

- [The design of Postgres storage system](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/papers/ERL-M87-06.pdf)

- [The Adaptive Radix Tree: ARTful Indexing for Main-Memory Databases](https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/ART.pdf)


### Miscellaneous

- [Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Mathematics](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~jmackey/151_128/bws_book.pdf)
